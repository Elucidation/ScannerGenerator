Torture is  practice or act of deliberately inflicting severe physical pain and possibly injury on a person, though psychological and animal torture also exist. Torture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals, groups and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day, and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or even longer. Reasons for torture can include punishment, revenge, political re-education, deterrence, interrogation or coercion of  victim or a third party, or simply  sadistic gratification of those carrying out or observing  torture. The torturer may or may not intend to kill or injure  victim, but sometimes torture is deliberately fatal and can accompany forms of murder or capital punishment. The aim may also be to inflict pain but without causing fatal injury, or sometimes any injury at all. In or cases,  torturer may be indifferent to  condition of  victim. There is also torture that can be fatal eventually, but where attempts are made not to kill  victim quickly to prolong  length of time of  suffering.
Although historically torture was sanctioned by some states, torture in  21st century is prohibited under international law and  domestic laws of most countries. It is considered to be a violation of human rights, and is declared to be unacceptable by Article 5 of  UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Signatories of  Third Geneva Convention and Fourth Geneva Convention officially agree not to torture prisoners in armed conflicts. Torture is also prohibited by  United Nations Convention Against Torture, which has been ratified by 147 countries.[1]
National and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical.[2] Despite se international conventions, organizations that monitor abuses of human rights (e.g. Amnesty International,  International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims) report widespread use condoned by states in many regions of  world.[3] Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some of m openly.[4]
