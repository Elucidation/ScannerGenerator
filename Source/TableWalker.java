	 * something we can't add to the current token. currentToken is where we
	 * hold the current set of characters we're dealing with. We add to it with
	 * every character from the file and we take things out of it when we need
	 * to pull out a valid token. startState is the very first state of the DFA.
	 * currentState is the state we're currently in. returnList is a list that
	 * holds the tokens we may need to return upon this character. It's a list
	 * for a reason that's easier to show in example than in text: Say our
	 * language accepts only "abd", "a", and "be". We feed the machine abe. When
	 * it sees a, it knows it can stop there, but it's going to continue looking
	 * for abd because it wants to get the longest token possible. It hits e,
	 * then realizes abd won't work. It then needs to go ahead and return both
	 * "a" and "be" on the same turn. So the list lets us do that.
